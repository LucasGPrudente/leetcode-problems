## [3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency)

<code>Easy</code> <code>Array</code> <code>Hash Table</code> <code>Counting</code>

<br>

You are given an array <code>nums</code> consisting of __positive__ integers.

Return *the __total frequencies__ of elements in* <code>nums</code> *such that those elements all have the __maximum__ frequency*.

The __frequency__ of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

<br> 

#### Example 1:

> __Input:__ nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
> 
> __Output:__ 4
> 
> __Explanation:__ The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
> So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.

#### Example 2:

> __Input:__ nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> __Output:__ 5
> 
> __Explanation:__ All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
> So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.

#### Constraints:

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 100</code>
- <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 100</code>
