## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Medium

Given a string <code>s</code>, find the length of the __longest substring__ without repeating characters.

#### Example 1:

> __Input:__ s = "abcabcbb"  
> __Output:__ 3  
> __Explanation:__ The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.  

#### Example 2:

> __Input:__ s = "bbbbb"  
> __Output:__ 1  
> __Explanation:__ The answer is "b", with the length of 1.  

#### Example 3:

> __Input:__ s = "pwwkew"   
> __Output:__ 3  
> __Explanation:__ The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.  
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

#### Constraints:

- <code>0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>s</code> consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
